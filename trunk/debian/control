Description: OpenFPC - An Open Full Packet Capture Setup
 OpenFPC is a set of scripts that combine to provide
 a lightweight full-packet network traffic recorder
 & buffering tool. It's design goal is to allow non-expert
 users to deploy a distributed network traffic recorder
 on COTS hardware while integrating into existing alert
 and log tools.
 .
 openfpc-common includes the perl libs that are needed
 for all openfpc control scripts.

 .
 openfpc-client can be installed on any system that will
 be used to contact a openfpc-proxy or openfpc-slaves in
 a openfpc installation.
 openfpc-client can be installed on the same host as the
 openfpc-proxy or openfpc-slave.

 .
 openfpc-slave is to be installed on the system that will
 be used for packet capturing.
 You can install openfpc-client on the same host if desired.
 It is recomended to do so if you want to be able to handle
 pcap extractions from that host only.
