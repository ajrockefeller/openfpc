openfpc for Debian
------------------

OpenFPC packet for debian is split into three packages.

  * openfpc-proxy
      This is to be used in an environment where you want to manage
      lots of slaves from one central host, to keep better track on
      auditlogs, users, and firewall/vpn access to slaves. This
      package can not co-exist with openfpc-slave.

  * openfpc-slave
      This is to be deployed on the actual sensor that is sniffing
      the network and storing packages (and also session data via 
      cxtracker). This package can not co-exist with openfpc-proxy.

  * openfpc-client
      The client that the security analyst/operators should use to
      search for and extract the actuall pcap data that they are
      looking for. openfpc-client can talk to both a openfpc-proxy 
      or a openfpc-slave. This package also has no conflicts with
      openfpc-proxy or openfpc-slave.
