# TODO

- GUI required
  Right now openfpc works for connection search and logline, but adding the following will allow integration with the ofpc-queued. 
   a) Calling ofpc-client for session extraction from the local archive (need to know what arbs needed to pass it, and how we want the file saved (path and file name)).
   b) Authentication, or should we rely on apache htaccess/mod_auth etc?

- Installer
  We need a shellscript or deb/rpm stuff.

- Init scripts.
  ...

- openfpc-client:
  *Fill inn functions that needs to be in place*


- Distributed system (ofpc proxy mode). 
  Let's leave this for now, it's wise to get a 1.0 release out first, the nice-to-have can come later.
